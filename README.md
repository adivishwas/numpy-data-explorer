# NumPy Data Explorer

A comprehensive beginner-friendly Python project demonstrating NumPy fundamentals for Data Science.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or directly:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Running the Project

Simply run:
```bash
python numpy_data_explorer.py
```

**No input required!** The script runs automatically and demonstrates all NumPy features.

## What This Project Covers

1. **NumPy Fundamentals**: Array creation, indexing, and slicing
2. **Mathematical Operations**: Element-wise, axis-wise, and statistical operations
3. **Reshaping and Broadcasting**: reshape, flatten, transpose, and broadcasting examples
4. **File I/O**: Saving and loading NumPy arrays
5. **Performance Comparison**: NumPy vs Python lists speed comparison

## Output Files

### Sample Outputs (Included in Repository)
- `sample_output.txt` - Complete output from running the script
- `OUTPUT_EXAMPLES.md` - Key highlights and performance results

### Generated Files (Created when you run the script)
- `saved_array_1d.npy` - Single array saved in NumPy format
- `saved_arrays.npz` - Multiple arrays saved in compressed format
- `saved_array_text.txt` - Array saved as human-readable text

**Note:** You can view the sample outputs without running the script to see what the project demonstrates!

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy 1.24.0 or higher

## Notes

- The script is fully automated - no user input needed
- All examples are demonstrated with clear outputs
- Performance tests show real-time comparisons
- All file operations are verified for correctness
